Title: About

----

Bio: From rawness to calmness, Suk Ja Kang plays spontaneously, resists definition, and sustains connection to the natural world and the spirit through contemporary abstract painting. Wandering through the imagined dichotomies of East and West, feminine/masculine, heavenly/earthy, Kang creates art that tunes a busy mind to experience the mystical and mundane present.  Her works are found in many corporate, private collections throughout the world. Her work has been reviewed by publications including Art In America, Art Papers, and New American Painting.
